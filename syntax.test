------------------------------------
/* What concepts do we need?
* - symbols/variables
* - blocks/anonymous functions
* - type aliases
* - structs/datatypes
* - assignment
* - error handling of some kind
* - basic datatypes
    - list
    - dict
    - string 
    - int 
    - bool
    - float
    - none
- state
- modules

Ok - everything is an (immutable) struct. There are no functions, just instantiations of the Block struct. Even the returns and touches fields should be slots on the struct, as should the actual list of statements. Typechecking/statefulness checking can happen via a generic framework for checking stuff at compile-time.
